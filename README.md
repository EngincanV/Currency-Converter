# Currency-Converter
In this project, i tried to use JSON and Ajax together. 
And I used API first time that very helped me to see how datas transform JSON objects and get transfer into the project.

## JSON

#### A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server. When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string. Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.

## AJAX

#### AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
     variable = new XMLHttpRequest(); //creating XMLHttpRequest
     
     open(method, url, async, user, psw)	Specifies the request

method: the request type GET or POST /
url: the file location / 
async: true (asynchronous) or false (synchronous) /
user: optional user name /
psw: optional password /
send()	Sends the request to the server /
Used for GET requests /
